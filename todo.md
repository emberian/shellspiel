messy code is permissible

but broken code is not

have some test scenarios along the way

replay actions on the sim

individual scenarios isolating every weapon type

2d grid of mini shellspiels in the page, each showing the effect of one weapon

figure out how to not use mk2 eyeball for noticing regressions

# tank

with a barrel

that can aim

and spawn new particles with velocity

# two tanks

that take turns spawning particles

# online

two browsers

one local network

take turns spawning particles, but together

# win

keep score on tank touch

celebrate the winner

# weapons

new particle types that explode

cosmetic effects are badass

a few of them

take turns selecting them pregame

# lobby

perhaps more than two browsers on network

find each other

decorate your name

# disable the editor

that probably shouldn't be allowed, should it

# move

tanks can move, can't they

somehow they interact with the ground

# unlocal

many local networks

one internetwork protocol

needs a server to do something

rust-libp2p?

# learn a computer player?

maybe rope grissess into tricking some sand into thinking

can it learn how to play unsupervised, from state dumps?

the difficulty is just training it less

# heuristic a computer player

cheat. just compute the perfect trajectory, pick a weapon randomly, and sometimes miss based on the <s>mercy</s> difficulty setting. move around every turn if feeling particularly feisty.
